Investigate user behavior for the company's app

You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.
First study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?
Then look at the results of an A/A/B test. (Read on for more information about A/A/B testing.) The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.
The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.
